# ROS Project. Politecnico di Milano
ROS projects for 'Robotics 2023-2024'course from Politecnico di Milano. 
---
##The first project:

Focuses on developing a ROS package for robotics applications. The tasks include creating three ROS nodes: gps_to_odom for converting GPS data to odometry, odom_to_tf for transforming odometry data into a TF frame, and lidar_remap for visualizing LiDAR data with dynamic frame adjustment. The project integrates odometry, GPS, and LiDAR data to enhance robot navigation and mapping capabilities, and uses ROS tools such as RViz for visualization and debugging.

##The second project:

Involves developing a ROS package for autonomous robot navigation and mapping. Task 1 focuses on creating a map of the environment from odometry and LiDAR data using a ROS bag file. Task 2 involves setting up a realistic simulation using the map, configuring the navigation stack to receive and follow goals, and creating a goal-publisher node to manage robot navigation through a sequence of goals. The project integrates mapping, simulation, and autonomous navigation, utilizing ROS tools such as RViz for visualization and debugging.
